# OpenRM

OpenRM is an open, self-hostable configuration and requirements management platform. The repository contains the interactive product preview and complete local implementations for requirements, controlled change, reviews, approvals, verification, and signed gate evidence.

## Development status

**Current stage:** 🟢 Phase 5 integration and beta hardening is complete; bounded pilot commissioning is next (updated 8 November 2026).

- 🟢 Phase 0, the interactive prototype and static delivery preview, is complete.
- 🟢 Phase 1 is complete: all foundation deliverables and local evidence checks are implemented.
- 🟢 Hosted OpenRM CI passes web, API, security-audit, migration, browser, accessibility, authenticated PostgreSQL, recovery, upgrade, and production-artifact checks.
- 🟢 The protected `main` branch requires `web`, `api`, `database-path`, `recovery-rehearsal`, and `production-artifact`, and disallows force-pushes and deletion.
- 🟢 Phase 2 is complete. Teams can create isolated projects, assign scoped roles, create and revise requirements, organize with folders and tags, validate typed attributes, save filtered views, compare history, and import/export JSON.
- 🟢 Controlled revisions and audit events are append-only, create/revise commands are idempotent, stale edits are rejected, and the primary browser workflow passes automated WCAG A/AA checks.
- 🟢 Phase 3 is complete: live graph/matrix/coverage queries, gap reporting, directed relationship controls, asynchronous suspect propagation, reviewer dispositions, attributable changesets, immutable baseline comparison, and deterministic signed evidence export pass locally and in [protected OpenRM CI run 42499758656](https://github.com/TJ-Engineer/OpenRM/actions/runs/42499758656).
- 🟢 Phase 4 is complete: baseline-bound reviews, segregation-of-duty approvals, immutable verification procedures, independent runs, signed results, content-addressed attachments, exact-revision coverage, explainable readiness, due events, and deterministic complete gate export pass locally and in [protected OpenRM CI run 42504423145](https://github.com/TJ-Engineer/OpenRM/actions/runs/42504423145).
- 🟢 Phase 5 is complete: governed Jira delivery/replay, Prometheus/OTLP observability, hardened deployment assets, recovery and upgrade rehearsals, three-browser/WCAG validation, load and security gates, and pilot operations procedures pass locally and in [protected OpenRM CI run 42508760769](https://github.com/TJ-Engineer/OpenRM/actions/runs/42508760769).

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | React/TypeScript web client and generated API types |
| `apps/api/` | Rust REST API, OIDC validation, policy harness, and operational endpoints |
| `contracts/` | Versioned OpenAPI contract |
| `db/migrations/` | PostgreSQL schema and deterministic local seed |
| `docs/adr/` | Accepted architecture decisions |
| `aws/` | Static preview infrastructure |
| `scripts/` | Bootstrap, checks, provisioning, and deployment |

The web client remains at the repository root to preserve the current Vite, AWS, and Sites deployments. Backend components are Cargo workspace members.

## Bootstrap

Prerequisites: Node.js 24+, Rust 1.96+, Docker, and npm.

```bash
npm run bootstrap
```

This creates `.env` from `.env.example`, starts PostgreSQL, installs JavaScript dependencies, generates TypeScript API types, and applies migrations.

Run the services in separate terminals:

```bash
npm run dev
cargo run -p openrm-api
```

The web client runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`; the API runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Verify the foundation

```bash
npm run check:foundation
```

For the database-backed path:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
cargo run -p openrm-api --bin migrate
cargo run -p openrm-api
```

Then verify:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ready
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer dev:local-user' \
  -H 'X-OpenRM-Organization: 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/session
```

Development tokens are rejected when `APP_ENV=production`. Deployed environments must use `AUTH_MODE=oidc` with an issuer and audience.

Role-scoped development tokens use `dev:<subject>:<role>`, where the role is `administrator`, `author`, `reviewer`, or `viewer`.

## Verify the controlled evidence slices

```bash
npm run check
npm run test:e2e
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
```

The protected `database-path` job applies all migrations to PostgreSQL 17 and exercises project isolation, controlled authoring, exact trace revisions, suspect resolution, changesets, signed baselines, review-package assembly, segregation of duties, blocker-controlled approval, independent verification, signed results and attachments, exact-revision coverage, gate readiness, deterministic complete export, Jira dead-letter/replay operations, security smoke tests, bounded load, stale-snapshot rejection, and append-only history. Separate jobs rehearse recovery/upgrades and build the production API image.

Phase 5 operating procedures are under [`docs/operations`](docs/operations), with the threat model and security review under [`docs/security`](docs/security).

## OpenRM product requirements in OpenRM

The repository includes a reproducible self-verification project containing 12 system requirements, 48 derived requirements, complete decomposition traceability, an independent review, and signed test, analysis, and observation evidence.

Validate the catalog and linked evidence files:

```bash
npm run check:self-project
```

Load or replay the controlled `OPENRM` project against a migrated local API:

```bash
npm run bootstrap:self-project
```

See the [OpenRM self-verification guide](docs/verification/OPENRM_SELF_VERIFICATION.md) for the requirement structure, evidence methods, integrity controls, and environment options.

## Contract workflow

Edit `contracts/openapi.yaml`, then regenerate the web types:

```bash
npm run generate:api
```

CI fails when committed generated types do not match the contract.

## Reset local data

```bash
docker compose down -v
npm run bootstrap
```

The `-v` operation deletes the disposable local PostgreSQL volume.
